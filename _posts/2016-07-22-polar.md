#### Abstract

We present a new approach to measuring political polarization, including a
novel algorithm and open source Python code, which leverages Twitter content
to produce measures of polarization for both users and hashtags. #Polar scores
provide advantages over existing measures because they (1) can be calculated
throughout the legislative cycle, (2) allow for easy differentiation between
users with similar scores, (3) are chamber-agnostic, and (4) are a generic
approach that can be applied beyond the U.S. Congress. #Polar scores leverage
available information such as party labels, word frequency, and hashtags to
create an accessible, straightforward algorithm for estimating polarity using
text.
