#### Abstract

Annotating data is a common bottleneck in building text classifiers. This is
particularly problematic in social media domains, where data drift requires
frequent retraining to maintain high accuracy. In this paper, we propose and
evaluate a text classification method for Twitter data whose only required
human input is a single keyword per class. The algorithm proceeds by
identifying exemplar Twitter accounts that are representative of each class by
analyzing Twitter Lists (human-curated collections of related Twitter
accounts). A classifier is then fit to the exemplar accounts and used to
predict labels of new tweets and users. We develop domain adaptation methods
to address the noise and selection bias inherent to this approach, which we
find to be critical to classification accuracy. Across a diverse set of tasks
(topic, gender, and political affiliation classification), we find that the
resulting classifier is competitive with a fully supervised baseline,
achieving superior accuracy on four of six datasets despite using no manually
labeled data.
