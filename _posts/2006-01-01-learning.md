#### Abstract

Named-entity recognition systems extract entities such as people,
organizations, and locations from unstructured text. Rather than extract these
mentions in isolation, this paper presents a *record extraction* system
that assembles mentions into records (i.e. database tuples). We construct a
probabilistic model of the compatibility between field values, then employ
graph partitioning algorithms to cluster fields into cohesive records. We also
investigate compatibility functions over *sets* of fields, rather than
simply pairs of fields, to examine how higher representational power can
impact performance. We apply our techniques to the task of extracting contact
records from faculty and student homepages, demonstrating a 53% error
reduction over baseline approaches.
