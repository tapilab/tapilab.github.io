The proliferation of social media -- such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, and Web
forums -- has created an unprecedented, continuous stream of messages
containing the thoughts, opinions, and beliefs of millions of people. In
addition to the primary benefit users of this technology enjoy, a secondary
benefit is emerging as scientists discover how to analyze this new data source
to provide insights into society. Evidence is mounting that such analysis can
be valuable in understanding public health, finance, politics, social unrest,
and natural disasters.

The goal of our research is two-fold: (1) to leverage this unprecedented
source of data to advance research in automated processing of informal human
communication; and (2) to apply these techniques to analyze trends in social
media and produce socially beneficial technology.
